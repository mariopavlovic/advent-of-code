# Intro
This Swift thing is getting really really cool, so why not try it a little bit and see what it can do. I'm using [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) to find interesting and fun tasks/problems. So, please bare in mind that this is just a fun/test repo and code here is most certainly not optimal or perfect as I've just started with Swift (my first lines of code)

# Request
If you find anything weird, or you know how to do it better, please let me know in any way:

- message
- pull request
- comment on commit
- ping me on Twitter ([@itsmariop](https://twitter.com/itsmariop))

Thanks in advance
